   <p style="border: 6px solid white;">Having only half of your teeth can significantly alter both the functionality and appearance of your smile. While it may seem challenging at first, itâ€™s important to remember that dental health is not solely dependent on having a full set of teeth. With proper care, those remaining teeth can still serve their purpose in chewing, speaking, and maintaining the structure of the mouth. However, it can affect your confidence and social interactions, especially if you're self-conscious about your smile. Solutions like partial dentures, dental implants, or bridges can help restore functionality and aesthetic appeal. Itâ€™s essential to work closely with a dentist to explore options that suit your unique needs and ensure long-term oral health.</p>
